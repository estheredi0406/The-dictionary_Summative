#The project name is "THE DICTIONARY" and it is an English dictionary app

#This fully functional project has been built using HTML CSS and JavaScript, with an integrated english dictionary free API. It has been built along with different Youtube videos explaining some concepts on implementing APIs in an app, and also building a dictionary using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This dictionary essentially allows the users to have access to a simple, reliable, and user-friendly app to extend their understanding of English words, and hence expanding their vocabulary. It is useful as it serves in educational purposes.
